## ðŸ“Œ Project Overview  
This project analyzes **coffee shop sales data from January to June 2023** to uncover business insights. Using **Power BI**, I transformed raw transactional data into interactive visualizations that explore:  
- Revenue and order trends over time  
- Weekday vs weekend performance  
- Store-level sales performance  
- Top-performing product categories and items  
- Daily/weekly sales patterns

## ðŸ“Š Key Insights  
- **Coffee & Tea dominate sales**, with bakery items as secondary contributors.  
- **Weekdays generate higher revenue** compared to weekends.  
- **Store performance varies** â€” some outlets consistently outperform others.  
- **Sales peaks occur in mornings and mid-days**, matching customer consumption behavior.

## ðŸš€ Recommendations  
1. Support underperforming outlets with targeted promotions.  
2. Diversify product sales by bundling underperforming categories with top sellers.  
3. Leverage customer timing patterns through morning combo deals and weekend campaigns.
